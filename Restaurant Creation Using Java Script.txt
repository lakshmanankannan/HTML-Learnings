JavaScript Served Hot — Restaurant Edition! 🍕

Practicing loops and conditions got tastier when I turned it into a restaurant project 😄

let menu = ["Idly", "Dosai", "Pongal"];
for(let i=0; i<menu.length; i++){
  document.write(menu[i] + " is ready to serve 🍽️<br>");
}

let pancakes = 3, customer = 1;
while(pancakes > 0){
  document.write("Serving Customer #" + customer + "<br>");
  pancakes--; customer++;
}

do {
  document.write("Preparing one more pancake 🥞<br>");
} while(pancakes > 0);

let order = "Ready";
switch(order){
  case "Ready": document.write("✅ Order is ready to serve!"); break;
  default: document.write("⏳ Cooking...");
}


From for loops to do...while, every concept felt more engaging when applied to a real-world scenario — like running a restaurant! 🍴
